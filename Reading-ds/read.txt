1. Kth algorithm - using heap
2. Sliding window algorithm - using Hash
3. Backtracking - tree - recursion
4. Dynamic programming
5. BFS -implemented using queue and DFS - is implemented using stack
6. Heap max heap and min heap - This is implemented using array - this is partially sorted - children at root node n is 2n+1, 2n+2 any array can be converted into heap using heaping method
8. Heap is used in yea-sort, Dijkstra's also, median maintenance of cream, priority queue need a quick access we use heap
7. Binary tree - Database indexing, Decision tree and sorting algorithm - It's used in recurssion,  traversal
8. Hash map and hash set
9. Stacks, queue
10. Graphs - Graph search - DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, topological, loop in graph
